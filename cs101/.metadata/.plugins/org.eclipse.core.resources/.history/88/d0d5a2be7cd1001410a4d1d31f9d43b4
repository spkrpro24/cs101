//1. Encapsulate the following code fragment, transforming it into a method 
//that takes a String as an argument and that returns the final value of count.
//2. In a sentence or two, describe what the resulting method does (without getting into the details of how).
//3. Now that you have generalized the code so that it works on any String, what could you do to generalize it more?
